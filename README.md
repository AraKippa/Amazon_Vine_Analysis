# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Mod 16 Challenge

The purpose of the this analysis was to determine for SellBy if there is any bias for paid "Vine" reviewers vs unpaid "Vine" reviewers.

## Results: 
- There were 10,215 Vine reviews and 2,633,026 non-Vine reviews [image](https://github.com/AraKippa/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/viney_n.PNG) for a total of 2,643,241 reviews collected.
- 1,645,283 of the reviews were five stars, with Vine reviewers contribting 10,215 five star reviews; and non Vine reviewers contributing 2,633,026 five star reviews. [image](https://github.com/AraKippa/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/pvu.PNG)
- This puts the percentage of five star Vine reviews at 0.26%. Non Vine reviewers five stars account for 99.74%. [image](https://github.com/AraKippa/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/percentpu.PNG) 
## Summary
There does not appear to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. The percentage of 5 star reviews is very small. It is difficult to determine statistical signifigance of the 0.26% without looking at other comparisons within the constraints of those who voted five stars. You could compare the percentage of five star reviewers from the Vine program to other categories of five star reviewers i.e. married vs unmarried, kids vs no kids
